I am hired because I know what I am doing, not because I will do whatever I am told is a good idea.

This might cost me bonuses, raises, promotions, and may even label me as "undesirable" by places I don’t want to work at anyway, but I don’t care.

I will not compromise my own principles and judgement without putting up a fight.

Of course, I won’t always win, and I will sometimes be forced to do things I don’t agree with. My objections will be made known.

If I am shown to be right and problems later develop, I will shout "I told you so!" repeatedly, laugh hysterically, and do a small dance or jig as appropriate to my heritage.
